If your distro doesn't offer yabasic, you need to compile it yourself. These instructions worked for me.

You will need a C compiler (usually gcc), flex and bison on your system. These are pretty much standard equipement on any Linux box.

Go to www.yabasic.de and download the Unix source code. Unpack the .tar.gz file into a directory. Open a terminal and cd to that directory.

Now you need to install some dependencies:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install libx11-dev libxt-dev ncurses-dev

now all you do is 

./configure
make
make check
sudo make install

There is a development version of yabasic on github. I suggest you stay away from it for now. Its Ruby based installer didn't do it for me.
