<h1>clasquinator</h1>

<p>This folder contains a library for yabasic that allows yabasic to display a variety of dialogs in text mode without making use of external commands.</p>

<p><em>Some</em> routines will also be made available in graphics mode, but keep in mind that you only have one graphics window to play with. if you use these, you will not have the graphics window for your own use.</p>

<p>The library is written as a textmode application and must be run in a terminal. It will not be useful in a headless script.</p>

<p>The entire set of libraries focuses on sane defaults and getting basic functionality into yabasic.</p>

<p>The images below are for illustration only. The exact appearance of the dialogs will depend on your system settings.</p>

<p>Developed on elementary OS 0.4 "Loki" (i.e. Linux), but it should work on any *NIX system that will run yabasic. I don't have a Windows machine to test this on, so please let me know if anything works/doesn't work on that side.</p>

<p>The library should exist either in the same folder as your program (symlinks work) or in the standard yabasic library location on your system.</p>

<p>To use the library, use the command </p>

<pre><code>import clasquinatorlib
</code></pre>

<p>You should <strong>not</strong> use this library and one of the others in this set that provides dialogs concurrently, because they replicate subroutine names. Pick the right one for your program and stick with it!</p>

<p>Currently still in planning stages and not really usable. But watch this space!</p>

<h2>Routines available:</h2>

<p>This library poaches as many ideas as possible from the other four dialog-providing libraries, but there is not 100% compatibility here, so we will not divide things into Common and Clasquinator-specific sections.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>ClearDlg</strong>() - on dialog and whiptail, this clears the dialog from your terminal. Same as the yabasic command CLEAR SCREEN, but may work better if you are expecting to issue another Linux command immediately. On zenity, clasquinator and kdialog, dummy routines are provided for compatibility so that you do not need to rewrite your code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>getcmd$</strong>() - returns the command set available.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is really just for me, to stop me from getting confused while I am editing four libraries simultaneously. </li>
<li>However, you could use it to test which utility (or library, in the case of clasquinator) is currently in use and if it is safe to use routines not in the common list.</li>
<li>e.g, <em>if getcmd$() = "clasquinator" SubmenuDlg(options ....)</em></li>
<li>or  <em>if getcmd$() = "zenity" ZNotifyDlg("this is a notification")</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>InputDlg$</strong>(text$, title$, ok$, cancel$) - Presents a one-line dialog into which the user can type a string answer.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>To Be Done</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>MenuDlg</strong>(text$, title$, ok$, cancel$, menustring$) - Create a menu of options for the user to choose from.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>To Be Done</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>MessageDlg</strong>(text$, ok$) - Display a simple message with an OK button.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>To Be Done</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>PasswordDlg$</strong>(text$, title$, ok$, cancel$) - Same as <em>InputDlg$</em> but with asterisks replacing the input text.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>To Be Done</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>RadioDlg</strong>(text$, title$, ok$, cancel$, menustring$, selected$) - Create a menu of options for the user to choose from.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>To Be Done</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>SubmenuDlg</strong>(text$, title$, ok$, cancel$, menustring$) - Create a secondary menu of options for the user to choose from.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>To Be Done</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>TestForDialogUtility$</strong>() - Routine to test if the called utility actually exists on the system. An empty string returned means it does, otherwise an error message is returned.</p>

<ul>
<li>in <em>clasquinator</em>, this is a dummy routine provided for compatibility. It will always return an empty string.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>TextFileDlg</strong>(filename$, title$, exit$) - Displays a text file.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>To Be Done</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>YesNoDlg</strong>(text$,yes$, no$) - Displays a dialog with text (normally a question) and the options to reply yes or no.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>To Be Done</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
