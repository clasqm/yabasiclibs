<h1>DEMO</h1>

<p>To run the demo program, open a terminal, cd to this folder and type the command</p>

<pre><code>yabasic demo.bas
</code></pre>

<p>It will give you the choice of which of the dialog-providing demos to run. Each of these are in fact standalone yabasic apps themselves and can be run the same way.</p>

<pre><code>yabasic dialog_demo.bas
yabasic kdialog_demo.bas
yabasic zenity_demo.bas
yabasic whiptail_demo.bas
yabasic clasquinator_demo.bas
yabasic clasquinator_demo2.bas
yabasic clasquinator_demo3.bas
yabasic clasquinator_demo4.bas
</code></pre>

<p><strong>NOTICE: Yabasic has a bug ATM where it will crash any script or menu you try to launch a yabasic app from (at least in Linux). I have reported this, but for now the main demo.bas program is nonfunctional.</strong></p>
