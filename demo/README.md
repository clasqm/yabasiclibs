# DEMO
To run the demo program, open a terminal, cd to this folder and type the command

    yabasic demo.bas

It will give you the choice of which of the dialog-providing demos to run. Each of these are in fact standalone yabasic apps themselves and can be run the same way.

    yabasic dialog_demo.bas
    yabasic kdialog_demo.bas
    yabasic zenity_demo.bas
    yabasic whiptail_demo.bas
    yabasic clasquinator_demo.bas
    yabasic clasquinator_demo2.bas
    yabasic clasquinator_demo3.bas
    yabasic clasquinator_demo4.bas

**NOTICE: Yabasic has a bug ATM where it will crash any script or menu you try to launch a yabasic app from (at least in Linux). I have reported this, but for now the main demo.bas program is nonfunctional.**
