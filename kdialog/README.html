<h1>yabasiclibs</h1>

<p>extension libraries for yabasic</p>

<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: KDE compatibility is a long-term goal for this project, after we have text-mode and GTK dialogs properly settled down. One day, I promise.</strong></p>

<p><strong>OK, I admit it, the only way to get kdialog is to install the whole KDE subsystem, with a bunch of apps I don't need. I'm not quite ready for that.</strong></p>

<h2>kdialog</h2>

<p>This folder contains a library for yabasic that allows the use of the Linux command <em>kdialog</em> to display a variety of dialogs in text mode.</p>

<p>The library will test for the presence of the kdialog command and will exit gracefully if it is not present</p>

<p>Developed on elementary OS 0.4 "Loki" (i.e. Linux), but it should work on any system that will run both yabasic and the kdialog command.</p>

<p>The library should exist either in the same folder as your program or in the standard yabasic library location on your system.</p>

<p>To use the library, use the command </p>

<pre><code>import kdialoglib
</code></pre>

<p>You should <strong>not</strong> use this library and one of the others in this set that provides dialogs concurrently, because they replicate subroutine names. Pick the right one for your program and stick with it!</p>
