<h1>Miscellaneous commands</h1>

<p>This folder contains a library for <em>yabasic</em> that allows the use of a variety of common Linux commands in text mode. For example, opening a text file in the <em>nano</em> text editor will make it unnecessary for you to write your own text editing routine.</p>

<p>This library also contains some routines ported from my libraries originally developed under yab for Haiku.</p>

<p>These routines make heavy use of <em>system()</em> and <em>system$()</em> commands, and some write temporary files, work on them, and read them back. They. will.  slow. your. programs. down. a. lot.</p>

<p>All are case-sensitive.</p>

<p>Developed on elementary OS 0.4 "Loki" (i.e. Linux), but it should work on any system that will run both yabasic and the command in question.</p>

<p>The <em>yabasic</em> I use for development is version 2.78.5, compiled and installed from source obtained at www.yabasic.de.</p>

<p>The library should exist either in the same folder as your program (symlinks work, but if you have trouble with binding, just copy the library, it is not THAT big!) or in the standard yabasic library location on your system.</p>

<p>To use the library, use the command </p>

<pre><code>import linuxmisclib
</code></pre>

<p><em>before</em> you start using any of the routines.</p>

<p>See the file <em>test.bas</em> for test routines that will show examples of how to use these routines.</p>

<p>It is safe to use this library and ONE of the others in this set concurrently,</p>

<h2>Routines available:</h2>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> All routines with the form <em>ConvertXXX\$()</em>, <em>OpenXXX\$()</em> or <em>OpeninXXX\$()</em> will return an empty string if successful or a warning message if the required program is missing. The warning message will only be displayed if you do something like:</p>

<pre><code>print OpeninTpp$("file.tpp")
</code></pre>

<p>(assuming <em>tpp</em> is not installed). Or you can test for its presence like this:</p>

<pre><code>if OpeninTpp$("file.tpp") &lt;&gt; "" {do something}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>ArraySort</strong>(a()) - sorts a ONE-dimensional numeric array. Do not try <em>a() =  ArraySort(a())</em>, it won't work. Your array should be global - I have had inconsistent results with local arrays. <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>sort</em>, <em>rm</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ArraySort\$</strong>(a\$()) - sorts a ONE-dimensional string array (case-independent). Do not try a\$() =  ArraySort\$(a\$()), it won't work. Your array should be global - I have had inconsistent results with local arrays. <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>sort</em>, <em>rm</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ConvertFile\$</strong>(infile\$, outfile\$) - Convert any <a href="#pandocformats">text file format</a> to any other format that <em>pandoc</em> (http://pandoc.org/) can handle. make sure that your two filenames have the correct extension added, then <em>pandoc</em> will almost always get it right. e.g <em>ConvertFile\$("myfile.md", "myfile.docx")</em> will convert a Markdown file to Microsoft .docx format (it does not delete the original file). <strong>NOTES</strong>: PDF output requires <em>pdflatex</em> or <em>wkhtmltopdf</em> to be installed as well as <em>pandoc</em>. Rather use <em>ConvertFile2PDF()</em> for that. Also, avoid RTF format output. Pandoc's version of this format seems nonstandard. <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>pandoc</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ConvertFile2PDF\$</strong>(infile\$, outfile\$) - Convert any <a href="#pandocformats">text file format</a> that <em>pandoc</em> (http://pandoc.org/) can handle to PDF. make sure that your infile's name has the correct extension added, and that your outfile's name ends with .pdf, then <em>pandoc</em> will almost always get it right. e.g. <em>ConvertFile2PDF\$("myfile.md", "myfile.pdf")</em> will convert a Markdown file to pdf format. <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>pandoc</em>, <em>wkhtmltopdf</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>EncloseString$</strong>(thestring$,type) - Encloses a string in either single or double quotes, if it isn't already. Mostly for use with long filenames that may include spaces. No error-checking is done here. If you feed this routine a string that already contains quotes, your program will come to a halt. Use INSTR() to check for that first. <strong>System commands used:</strong> none.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FileExists</strong>(fullpathname$) - Test if a file exists. Returns 1 if the file exists, or returns 0 if the file does not exist. If only a filename is given, only the program's local directory will be searched.But you can also give a full pathname. <strong>System commands used:</strong> none.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FileorDir</strong>(fullpathname$) - Test if a file (in the Unix sense) is a regular file or a directory. Returns 1 if it is a directory, 0 if it is just a regular file. <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>test</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FileorLink</strong>(fullpathname$) - Test if a file (in the Unix sense) is a regular file or a symbolic link. Returns 1 if it is a link, 0 if it is just a regular file. This does NOT test for hard links. <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>test</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>IsFileZeroByte</strong>(pathname$) - determines if a passed filename is a zero-byte file.  Returns 0 (false) if the passed variable is larger than zero bytes, and returns 1 (true) if it is zero bytes in size (note that this reverses the output of the <em>test -s</em> command). <strong>Caution:</strong> will also return 1 if file does not exist: test for that with <em>FileExists</em> first. It will also return 0 if file is actually a directory: test for that with <em>FileorDir</em> first. If the file given is a symlink, this routine will report on the real, linked file. This yabasic routine is incompatible with a similar routine I wrote for yab. If you program in both languages, you need to reverse the conditions. <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>test</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>IsItATextFile</strong>(filename$) - Tests whether a given file is a text file or not. Anything that does not have the string "text" in the results of the <em>file</em> command is assumed to be a binary file. This should work fine on Linux but may be problematic on BSD systems (including MacOS?) where this command may reject shell scripts. if you need something more powerful than <em>file</em>, I suggest you install <em>enca</em>. <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>file</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OpenCalcurse\$</strong>() - Opens the <em>calcurse</em> text-mode calendar app. Only the default calendar is provided for in this routine. <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>calcurse</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OpenInJed\$</strong>(filename\$) - opens a given text file in the <em>jed</em> text editor in the same terminal window as your program. Will fail and return an error message if <em>jed</em> does not exist on your system. If <em>filename\$</em> does not exist, <em>jed</em> will create one in memory and let you save it. If filename$ is an empty string (""), <em>jed</em> will open with a new, unnamed file (You can also use the shortcut <strong>OpenJed\$</strong>() for this).For best results your filename should be enclosed in single quotation marks so that it will not get confused by spaces. This routine will not check for that.You may have to CLEAR SCREEN and rebuild your screen afterwards. <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>jed</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OpeninElinks\$</strong>(URL$): Opens a URL in the <em>elinks</em> text-based browser. Must be run in a program that is already in a terminal. Will fail and return an error message if <em>elinks</em> does not exist on your system. For best results your URL should be enclosed in single quotation marks so that it will not get confused by spaces. This routine will not check for that. <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>elinks</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OpeninLinks\$</strong>(URL$): Opens a URL in the <em>links</em> text-based browser. Must be run in a program that is already in a terminal. Will fail and return an error message if <em>links</em> does not exist on your system. For best results your URL should be enclosed in single quotation marks so that it will not get confused by spaces. This routine will not check for that. <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>links</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OpeninLynx\$</strong>(URL$): Opens a URL in the <em>lynx</em> text-based browser. Must be run in a program that is already in a terminal. Will fail and return an error message if <em>lynx</em> does not exist on your system. For best results your URL should be enclosed in single quotation marks so that it will not get confused by spaces. This routine will not check for that. <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>lynx</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OpenInNano\$</strong>(filename\$) - opens a given text file in the <em>nano</em> text editor in the same terminal window as your program. Will fail and return an error message if <em>nano</em> does not exist on your system. If <em>filename\$</em> does not exist, <em>nano</em> will create one in memory and let you save it. If filename$ is an empty string (""), <em>nano</em> will open with a new, unnamed file (You can also use the shortcut <strong>OpenNano</strong>\$() for this). For best results your filename should be enclosed in single quotation marks so that it will not get confused by spaces. This routine will not check for that.You may have to CLEAR SCREEN and rebuild your screen afterwards. <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>nano</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OpenInTpp\$</strong>(filename\$) - Opens a given  file in the <em>tpp</em> text presentation program. Must be run in a program that is already in a terminal. For best results your filename should be enclosed in single quotation marks so that it will not get confused by spaces. This routine will not check for that. It is up to you to determine that filename$ is a valid <em>tpp</em> data file. <strong>NOTE</strong> that if you want to use <em>tpp</em>'s <em>--huge</em> facility, then <em>figlet</em> must also be installed. To see all <em>tpp</em> can do, run the bash command <em>tpp /usr/share/doc/tpp/examples/tpp-features.tpp</em>. <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>tpp</em>, <em>figlet</em> (optional).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OpeninW3m\$</strong>(URL$): Opens a URL in the <em>w3m</em> text-based browser. Must be run in a program that is already in a terminal. Will fail and return an error message if <em>w3m</em> does not exist on your system. For best results your URL should be enclosed in single quotation marks so that it will not get confused by spaces. This routine will not check for that. <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>w3m</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>OpeninWordgrinder\$</strong>(filename\$) - Opens a given  file in the <em>wordgrinder</em> word processor. Must be run in a program that is already in a terminal. If filename\$ is an empty string (""), <em>wordgrinder</em> will open with a new, unnamed file (You can also use the shortcut <strong>OpenWordgrinder\$()</strong> for this). For best results your filename should be enclosed in single quotation marks so that it will not get confused by spaces. This routine will not check for that.  It is up to you to determine that filename\$ is a valid <em>wordgrinder</em> data file. <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>wordgrinder</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OpenTina$</strong>() - Opens the <em>tina</em> text-based personal information manager. Only the default database is provided for in this routine. <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>tina</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>StripLFoffSysCmd$</strong>(val$) -  Remove linefeeds from the results of a system call. If the results of a system() or system\$() command end on a LF (most do), strip the LF off and return the resulting string. But it can be used for any string that might have a suspected and unwanted LF at the end. If there is no LF present, it does nothing. This may not work on Windows systems, where you also need to test for a CR but we are not writing this library for Windows in any case. <strong>System commands used:</strong> none</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TestForUtility$</strong>(filename\$) - tests whether a given utility exists on your $PATH and is executable. Returns an empty string if the utility exists, and a warning message if it does not (this reverses the functionality of the Linux <em>which</em> command). This command is used by many of the other routines in this library, and a version of it can be found in the each of the various dialog libraries. If the required program does not exist.  <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>which</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>URLExist</strong>(URL\$) and <strong>URLExist\$</strong>(URL\$) do the equivalent job of testing whether a URL exists before sending it to <em>OpeninLinks</em>(), for example. The difference is whether the <em>1</em> (it exists) or 0 (it does not exist) is sent as a numeric or string result. See the file <em>test.bas</em> for the different ways to use these routines.  <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>curl</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>WhereAmI$</strong>() - returns the current directory from which the program is running.  <strong>System commands used:</strong> <em>pwd</em>.</p></li>
