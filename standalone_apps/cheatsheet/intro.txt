Extension libraries for yabasic.

A series of libraries for yabasic , the BASIC dialect by Marc Ihm, that give access to a number of common utilities on Linux, mostly intended to provide standard dialogs. Not tested on other UNIX platforms, but it should be possible to adjust them accordingly.

This does not make yabasic able to write full-on graphical programs, like its own derivative yab on the Haiku platform, but it does allow you to use yabasic as the backend for "wizard"-style applications.

This software is still very much in the alpha stage. The routines in the libraries work, but need a lot of optimization and error-trapping.

The library should exist either in the same folder as your program (symlinks work) or in the standard yabasic library location on your system. There is a .deb file available for those of you who are on Debian-derived systems, but I am pretty new at building .deb files, so I would appreciate feedback!

Developed on elementary OS 0.4 "Loki" and Lubuntu 18.04 (i.e. Linux), but it should work on any *NIX system that will run yabasic. Testing on Windows has been far more sketchy, since I don't have a windows box here, but I did what I could in my lunch break at work ;-). Don't tell my boss.
