# YABIDE.SH

This is my homebrewed IDE for yabasic
It requires few external dependencies:

**yabasic** (well, duh)  
**tilde** text editor (but you can easily change it to your favourite editor)  
**egrep**  
**tput**, but that is part of ncurses, so you should have it already if you have yabasic  
**smenu** - available in some linux distros or easily compiled from source at https://github.com/p-gen/smenu  

**bugs:** rivalling the Amazon rainforest. I am a better yabasic than bash programmer, and that's not saying much!

**Future plans:** None, but who knows what brainwave I may have one day?

With thanks to StackEchange, LinuxQuestions ...
