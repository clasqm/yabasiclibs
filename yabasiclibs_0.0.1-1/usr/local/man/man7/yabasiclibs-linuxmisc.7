.PP
This folder contains a library for \f[I]yabasic\f[] that allows the use
of a variety of common Linux commands in text mode.
For example, opening a text file in the \f[I]nano\f[] text editor will
make it unnecessary for you to write your own text editing routine.
.PP
This library also contains some routines ported from my libraries
originally developed under yab for Haiku.
.PP
These routines make heavy use of \f[I]system()\f[] and
\f[I]system$()\f[] commands, and some write temporary files, work on
them, and read them back.

down.
a.
lot.
Also, ensuring that you (or your users) have the appropriate packages
installed will be up to you.
The routines themselves only check for the existence of the binary and
exit if it is not found.
All I can tell you is that every utility used here was found in the
Ubuntu repositories.
\f[I]apt\-cache search\f[] is your friend.
.PP
All routines are case\-sensitive.
.PP
Developed on elementary OS 0.4 "Loki" (i.e.
Linux), but it should work on any system that will run both yabasic and
the command in question.
.PP
The \f[I]yabasic\f[] I use for development is version 2.78.5, compiled
and installed from source obtained at www.yabasic.de.
.PP
The library should exist either in the same folder as your program
(symlinks work, but if you have trouble with binding, just copy the
library, it is not THAT big!) or in the standard yabasic library
location on your system.
.PP
To use the library, use the command
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
import\ linuxmisclib
\f[]
.fi
.PP
\f[I]before\f[] you start using any of the routines.
.PP
See the file \f[I]test.bas\f[] for test routines that will show examples
of how to use these routines.
.PP
It is safe to use this library and ONE of the others in this set
concurrently,
