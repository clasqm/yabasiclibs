Extension libraries for yabasic.
.PP
A series of libraries for yabasic (http://www.yabasic.de/) , the BASIC
dialect by Marc Ihm (https://github.com/marcIhm), that give access to a
number of common utilities on Linux.
Not tested on other UNIX platforms, but it should be possible to adjust
them accordingly.
.PP
This software is still very much in the alpha stage.
The routines in the libraries work, but need a lot of optimization and
error\-trapping.
.SS The libraries
.IP \[bu] 2
clasquinator.yab (https://clasqm.github.io/yabasiclibs/clasquinator/) \-
a yabasic library that attempts to reproduce the functionality of the
other four dialog\-providing libraries purely from within yabasic.
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]This library is not 100% compatible with the other four and likely
never will be!\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
This library should work in yabasic for Windows too, but testing has
been not been very extensive on that platform.
.IP \[bu] 2
Currently in alpha.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
dialoglib.yab (https://clasqm.github.io/yabasiclibs/dialog/) \- allows
the use of the Linux command \f[I]dialog\f[] to display a variety of
graphical dialogs in text mode.
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
Currently in alpha stage.
.RE

kdialoglib.yab (https://clasqm.github.io/yabasiclibs/kdialog/) \- allows
the use of the Linux command \f[I]kdialog\f[] to display a variety of
graphical dialogs.
.RS 2

Currently in alpha stage.

linuxmisclib.yab (https://clasqm.github.io/yabasiclibs/linuxmisc/) \-
allows the use of a variety of common Linux text\-mode commands and
applications.
Also contains a few routines that I just found myself doing over and
over.

Currently in alpha stage.

whiptaillib.yab (https://clasqm.github.io/yabasiclibs/whiptail/) \-
allows the use of the Linux command \f[I]whiptail\f[] to display a
variety of dialogs in text mode.
.RS 2

Currently in alpha stage.

zenitylib.yab (https://clasqm.github.io/yabasiclibs/zenity/) \- allows
the use of the Linux command \f[I]zenity\f[] to display a variety of
graphical dialogs.

For instructions, see the separate README file for each of these
libraries.
Each library also comes with a \f[I]test.bas\f[] file in which each new
function is supplied with an example.
Just remove the comments from the example you want to test, save the
changes and run the command
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
yabasic\ test.bas
\f[]
.fi
.PP
within the same folder where the library resides.
.PP
There is also a \f[I]demo\f[] folder where some of the capabilities of
the system are demonstrated in short programs.
See here (https://clasqm.github.io/yabasiclibs/demo/) for instructions.
.PP
Please note that the libraries that give access to dialog boxes cannot
be mixed in the same program, as they will create an unholy mess of
namespace confusion.
Pick one and stick with it! However, the \f[I]linuxmisclib\f[] library
can be safely combined with any one of the others.
.PP
The four external dialog\-providing routines have common commands as
well as dialog\-specific ones.
If your program sticks religiously to the common routines, you will be
able to change it from, say, zenity to kdialog by changing a single
\f[I]import\f[] statement.

.SS What will \f[I]not\f[] be included
.IP \[bu] 2
Routines to use other GUI apps.
There is no possible way to write a routine for every graphical text
editor in Linux.
And that is just the text editors.
My routines are very straightforward and you should be able to adapt
them to your own needs.
.IP \[bu] 2
Anything to do with emacs.
Friends don\[aq]t let friends use emacs.
.IP \[bu] 2
In \f[I]linuxmisclib\f[], routines that start up in a new xterm.
Well, maybe much later.
.IP \[bu] 2
In \f[I]dialog\f[], the directory\- and file\-selectors.
Too clunky to be allowed to live, and there is nothing compatible in
\f[I]whiptail\f[] anyway.
.IP \[bu] 2
The entire set of libraries focuses on sane defaults and getting basic
functionality into yabasic.
There are a lot of obscure switches (esp.
in \f[I]kdialog\f[] and \f[I]zenity\f[]) that will not be implemented!
