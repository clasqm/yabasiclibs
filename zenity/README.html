<h1>zenity</h1>

<p>This folder contains a library for yabasic that allows the use of the Linux command <em>zenity</em> to display a variety of dialogs in graphical mode.</p>

<p>The library will test for the presence of the zenity command and will exit gracefully if it is not present.Zenity is a GTK program, so the colours and styles will follow that of your GNOME defaults. It may also take a moment or two to pop up - there are a lot of libraries to load! If speed is of the essence, stick to the <em>dialog</em> or <em>whiptail</em> libraries.</p>

<p>The entire set of libraries focuses on sane defaults and getting basic functionality into yabasic. There are a lot of options that will not be implemented!</p>

<p>The images below are for illustration only. The exact appearance of the dialogs will depend on your system settings.</p>

<p>Developed on elementary OS 0.4 "Loki" (i.e. Linux), but it should work on any system that will run both yabasic and the zenity command.</p>

<p>The library should exist either in the same folder as your program or in the standard yabasic library location on your system.</p>

<p>To use the library, use the command</p>

<pre><code>import zenitylib
</code></pre>

<p>You should <strong>not</strong> use this library and one of the others that provides dialogs in this set concurrently, because they replicate subroutine names. Pick the right one for your program and stick with it!</p>

<h2>Routines available:</h2>

<h3>Common Routines</h3>

<p><strong>These routines are available on any of the four dialog-providing libraries.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>ClearDlg</strong>() - on dialog and whiptail, this clears the dialog from your terminal. Same as the yabasic command CLEAR SCREEN, but may work better if you are expecting to issue another Linux command immediately.On zenity and kdialog, dummy routines are provided for compatibility so that you do not need to rewrite your code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>getcmd$</strong>() - return the name of the dialog-providing utility currently being accessed.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is really just for me, to stop me from getting confused while I am editing four libraries simultaneously.</li>
<li>However, you could use it to test which utility is currently running and if it is safe to use routines not in the common list.</li>
<li>e.g. <em>if getcmd$() = "zenity" ZNotifyDlg("this is a notification")</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>InputDlg$</strong>(text$, title$, ok$, cancel$) - Presents a one-line dialog into which the user can type a string answer.</p>

<ul>
<li>The value <em>title$</em> has no effect in zenity but is kept here for compatibility and must be supplied.</li>
<li>The value <em>ok$</em> is the text of the accept button, normally OK.</li>
<li>The value <em>cancel$</em> is the text of the reject button, normally Cancel.</li>
<li>The result is returned as a string value.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>MenuDlg</strong>(text$, title$, ok$, cancel$, menustring$) - Create a menu of options for the user to choose from
<ul>
<li>The value <em>title$</em> has no effect in zenity, but is kept here for compatibility and must be supplied.</li>
<li>The value <em>ok$</em> is the text of the accept button, normally OK.</li>
<li>The value <em>cancel$</em> is the text of the reject button, normally Cancel.</li>
<li>The value menustring$ is the list of menu options as a single string, separated by hash signs (#). Spaces are allowed.</li>
<li>If the number of options exceed the available space in the widget, the list will be scrollable.</li>
<li>The result is returned as a numeric value, starting from 1.</li>
<li>If you prefer to get the same number in string format, you can use <strong>MenuDlg$</strong>(text$, title$, ok$, cancel$, menustring$)</li>
<li>Please note that the height of this widget is hardcoded at 400 pixels, because it looked really crap when allowed to autosize. This may change with future releases of zenity.</li>
<li><em>EXAMPLE: a = MenuDlg("This is a menu", "A Menu!","Accept", "Deny", "Science#Religion#Magic#All of the above"): print a</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>PasswordDlg$</strong>(text$, title$, ok$, cancel$) - Same as <em>InputDlg$</em> but with asterisks replacing the input text.
<ul>
<li>The value <em>title$</em> has no effect in zenity, but is kept here for compatibility and must be supplied.</li>
<li>The value <em>ok$</em> is the text of the accept button, normally OK</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>RadioDlg</strong>(text$, title$, ok$, cancel$, menustring$, selected$) - Create a menu of options for the user to choose from
<ul>
<li>Same as <em>MenuDlg</em>(), except that radiobuttons are presented in the first column. Unlike the other dialog-creating utilities, you cannot choose which one to pre-select.</li>
<li>The value <em>title$</em> has no effect in zenity, but is kept here for compatibility and must be supplied.</li>
<li>The value <em>ok$</em> is the text of the accept button, normally OK.</li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>TestForDialogUtility\$</strong>() - Routine to test if the called utility actually exists on the system. An empty string returned means it does, otherwise an error message is returned.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TextFileDlg</strong>(filename$, title$, exit$) - Displays a text file.</p>

<ul>
<li>The value <em>title$</em> has no effect on zenity, but is used here for compatibility reasons and must be supplied.</li>
<li>The value <em>exit$</em> is the title of the button, normally "OK"</li>
<li>Text wrapping varies from one dialog-provider to the next. It is better if you preformat your text file.</li>
<li>Returns nothing.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="./imgs/TextFileDlg.png" alt="TextFileDlg" title="" /></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>YesNoDlg</strong>(text$,yes$, no$) - Displays a dialog with text (normally a question) and the options to reply yes or no.
<ul>
<li>in <em>dialog</em>, the first CAPITAL letter of the yes$ and no$ variables will become the hotkeys for those buttons, so make sure they are different. This does not matter for the other dialog-providing utilities.</li>
<li>Returns 1 for yes and 0 for no.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
